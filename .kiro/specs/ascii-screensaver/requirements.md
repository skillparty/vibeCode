# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for a complete web screensaver application that combines animated ASCII art patterns with philosophical programming quotes called "The Way of Code". The application focuses primarily on hypnotic and relaxing ASCII pattern animations that serve as the main visual element, with programming philosophy quotes elegantly overlaid on top. The screensaver is designed specifically for developers and creates a cyberpunk/retro atmosphere perfect for coding environments.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: ASCII Pattern Animation System

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to see multiple animated ASCII patterns as the primary visual element, so that I can enjoy a hypnotic and relaxing screensaver experience while maintaining a coding aesthetic.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the screensaver is active THEN the system SHALL display animated ASCII patterns as the primary background element
2. WHEN displaying ASCII patterns THEN the system SHALL support at least 8 different pattern types including Matrix Rain, Binary Waves, Geometric ASCII, Terminal Cursor, Code Flow, Mandelbrot ASCII, Conway's Life, and Network Nodes
3. WHEN rendering ASCII patterns THEN the system SHALL maintain 60fps smooth animation performance
4. WHEN transitioning between patterns THEN the system SHALL provide smooth morphing effects including fade overlay, displacement, and glitch transitions
5. WHEN displaying patterns THEN the system SHALL use monospace fonts ('Courier New', 'Monaco', 'Consolas') for consistent character rendering
6. WHEN patterns are active THEN the system SHALL implement a multi-layer system with background, middle, and foreground layers
7. WHEN screen size changes THEN the ASCII grid SHALL adapt responsively to maintain proper character spacing and alignment

### Requirement 2: Programming Philosophy Quote Integration

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to read inspiring "Way of Code" philosophical quotes overlaid on the ASCII patterns, so that I can reflect on programming wisdom during breaks.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the screensaver displays quotes THEN the system SHALL include a collection of at least 25-30 philosophical programming quotes
2. WHEN displaying quotes THEN the system SHALL overlay them elegantly on top of ASCII patterns using backdrop blur effects
3. WHEN quotes change THEN the system SHALL synchronize quote transitions with ASCII pattern changes
4. WHEN quotes are displayed THEN the system SHALL ensure text remains legible with proper contrast and shadow effects
5. WHEN quotes appear THEN the system SHALL use smooth fade-in/fade-out animations with configurable timing
6. WHEN displaying quotes THEN the system SHALL support both sequential and shuffle playback modes
7. WHEN quotes are shown THEN the system SHALL maintain color harmony between ASCII patterns and typography

### Requirement 3: User Configuration and Controls

**User Story:** As a user, I want to customize the screensaver behavior and appearance, so that I can tailor the experience to my preferences.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accessing settings THEN the system SHALL provide a configuration panel with transition speed control (5-20 seconds)
2. WHEN configuring THEN the system SHALL allow selection of different transition effects (fade, slide, typewriter, rotate3d)
3. WHEN setting preferences THEN the system SHALL offer multiple visual themes (matrix, terminal, retro, blue)
4. WHEN configuring THEN the system SHALL provide day/night mode options
5. WHEN using controls THEN the system SHALL support manual navigation with arrow keys for advancing/retreating quotes
6. WHEN settings change THEN the system SHALL persist configuration in localStorage between sessions
7. WHEN in presentation mode THEN the system SHALL allow manual control for displaying specific quotes

### Requirement 4: Screensaver Activation and Behavior

**User Story:** As a user, I want the screensaver to automatically activate during periods of inactivity and exit immediately when I return, so that it functions like a traditional screensaver.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN user is inactive for 3 minutes THEN the system SHALL automatically activate screensaver mode
2. WHEN detecting user activity (mouse movement or keyboard input) THEN the system SHALL immediately exit screensaver mode
3. WHEN screensaver is active THEN the system SHALL support fullscreen mode using the Fullscreen API
4. WHEN tab is not visible THEN the system SHALL pause animations using Page Visibility API to conserve resources
5. WHEN screensaver runs THEN the system SHALL maintain CPU usage below 5% during idle periods
6. WHEN active for extended periods THEN the system SHALL function without memory leaks for 8+ hours
7. WHEN exiting THEN the system SHALL provide smooth transition back to normal interface

### Requirement 5: Performance and Technical Implementation

**User Story:** As a user, I want the screensaver to run smoothly without impacting system performance, so that I can leave it running without concerns about resource usage.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN rendering animations THEN the system SHALL use requestAnimationFrame for smooth 60fps performance
2. WHEN managing memory THEN the system SHALL keep memory usage below 50MB during operation
3. WHEN rendering ASCII THEN the system SHALL use Canvas 2D API with optimized character rendering
4. WHEN handling events THEN the system SHALL implement debouncing for resize and mousemove events
5. WHEN loading resources THEN the system SHALL implement lazy loading for visual effects
6. WHEN optimizing performance THEN the system SHALL use CSS contain properties and will-change declarations
7. WHEN cleaning up THEN the system SHALL properly remove event listeners and clear timers in useEffect cleanup

### Requirement 6: Accessibility and User Experience

**User Story:** As a user with accessibility needs, I want the screensaver to be usable and considerate of different abilities, so that everyone can enjoy the application safely.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN providing interface elements THEN the system SHALL include proper ARIA labels and roles
2. WHEN managing focus THEN the system SHALL implement proper focus management and tabindex
3. WHEN displaying content THEN the system SHALL use semantic HTML5 structure with main, section, article, nav, and aside elements
4. WHEN showing dynamic content THEN the system SHALL use aria-live regions for screen reader announcements
5. WHEN considering motion sensitivity THEN the system SHALL provide options to reduce animation intensity
6. WHEN using keyboard THEN the system SHALL support full keyboard navigation
7. WHEN providing feedback THEN the system SHALL include visual feedback for all interactive elements

### Requirement 7: Advanced Features and Extensibility

**User Story:** As a power user, I want advanced features like favorites and different viewing modes, so that I can have more control over my screensaver experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN using favorites THEN the system SHALL allow marking and filtering favorite quotes
2. WHEN in focus mode THEN the system SHALL provide a less distracting mode for use while programming
3. WHEN managing quotes THEN the system SHALL support adding custom quotes through the interface
4. WHEN using different modes THEN the system SHALL support both automatic and manual progression modes
5. WHEN exporting/importing THEN the system SHALL allow backup and restore of user preferences
6. WHEN extending functionality THEN the system SHALL provide hooks for adding new ASCII patterns
7. WHEN integrating THEN the system SHALL be designed to support future database integration for quote management
